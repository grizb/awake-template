God’s law is our only safe guard for individual integrity, for the happiness of the home, the wellbeing of society, or the stability of the nation. How are we raising our children?

Raising children is a God given task and the primary responsibility of every parent. But what does it entail to raise children for God, is it just providing them with food and shelter? Indeed, it is more than that it entails showing them love and affection, setting limits, monitoring the child, and if the limits are crossed disciplining them it also involves teaching them that there are consequences for their actions.

 Most of all if you are raising children and you want them to be people of good character you have to raise them up in the fear of the lord. The law of God is the standard of moral character. The does and don’ts in the law of God is a hedge of protection. The law will protect them from harming themselves and others. The law will teach them to love God and others. It will give them peace of mind and happiness. In this regard the parent should set a good example by living a life of obedience to God themselves. The children are watching them, and imitating.

The happiness of your children depends on their obedience to the law of God. Therefore, it should be the objective of every parent to ensure that their children learn obedience. But these days people don’t focus on this when educating their children. Children are pampered and left to have their own way.

Children who are left to have their own way without parents setting limits are unhappy children. Children will be happier under proper discipline than if left to have their own way. As children obey their wise parental control the children will learn to love God and love others. Because the limits the parents will be making for the child will be according to Gods law. Which prescribes what it means to love God and what it means to love others.
